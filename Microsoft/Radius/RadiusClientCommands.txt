RADIUS client commands
The following entries provide details for each command.

 Important

Client computers, such as wireless portable computers and other computers running client operating systems, are not RADIUS clients. RADIUS clients are network access servers—such as wireless access points, 802.1X-capable switches, virtual private network (VPN) servers, and dial-up servers—because they use the RADIUS protocol to communicate with RADIUS servers such as Network Policy Server (NPS) servers.

add client
Adds a RADIUS client to the Network Policy Server (NPS) configuration.

Syntax
add client [ name = ] name [ address = ] address [ state = ] Enable | Disable [ [ sharedsecret = ] sharedsecret [ requireauthattrib = ] Yes | No [ napcompatible = ] Yes | No [ vendorname = ] vendorname ] ]

Parameters
name
Required. Specifies the friendly name of the RADIUS client.
address
Required. Specifies the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) or IP address of the RADIUS client.
state
Optional. Specifies whether the RADIUS client is enabled or disabled. The default is enabled.
sharedsecret
Optional. Specifies the shared secret that is also configured at the RADIUS client. The shared secret is used to validate messages between the RADIUS client and NPS.
requireauthattrib
Optional. Specifies whether verification for Access-Request messages is enabled or disabled. The default is disabled.
napcompatible
Optional. Specifies whether the RADIUS client is compatible with Network Access Protection (NAP). The default is No, which means that the RADIUS client is not compatible with Network Access Protection (NAP).
vendor
Optional. Specifies the RADIUS client vendor name. The default is RADIUS standard.
Example
In the following example, a NAP-compatible wireless access point is added as a RADIUS client to the NPS configuration. This RADIUS client has the name WirelessAP, the IP address 10.0.0.200, an enabled state, and a shared secret of 9vq7822hFsJ8rm.

netsh nps add client name= WirelessAP address= 10.0.0.200 state=Enable sharedsecret=9vq7822hFsJ8rm napcompatible=Yes

Remarks
RADIUS clients are network access servers, such as a dial-up server, wireless access point, or virtual private network (VPN) server. Client computers, also called access clients, are not RADIUS clients.
delete client
Deletes one or more existing RADIUS clients.

Syntax
delete client [ name= ] name

Parameters
name
Required. Specifies the friendly name of the RADIUS client that you want to delete. If more than one RADIUS client is specified, the friendly names must be separated by commas.
Example
Following is an example of the command usage. In this example, three wireless access points with the friendly names WirelessAP1, WirelessAP2, and WirelessAP3 are removed as RADIUS clients from the NPS configuration.

delete client WirelessAP1,WirelessAP2,WirelessAP3

rename client
Changes the friendly name of a RADIUS client.

Syntax
rename client [ name = ] name [ newname = ] newname

Parameters
name
Required. Specifies the friendly name of the RADIUS client that you want to rename.
newname
Required. Specifies the new friendly name for the RADIUS client.
reset client
Deletes all RADIUS clients that are configured in NPS.

 Warning

Do not run this command if you want to maintain any of the RADIUS client settings you have configured at the NPS server. This command deletes all RADIUS client settings that you have configured, and after running this command, your settings cannot be recovered. Before you run this command, it is recommended that you use the export command to save the NPS server configuration to an XML file.

Syntax
reset client

set client
Changes the value of one or more properties of an existing RADIUS client. This command cannot be used to change the RADIUS client friendly name. For other properties, values specified by this command overwrite the existing values.

Syntax
setclient [ name = ] name [ address = ] address [ state = ] Enable | Disable [ [ sharedsecret = ] sharedsecret [ requireauthattrib = ] Yes | No [ napcompatible = ] Yes | No [ vendorname = ] vendorname ] ]

Parameters
name
Required. Specifies the RADIUS client friendly name. To change the RADIUS client friendly name, use the rename client command.
address
Optional. Specifies the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) or IP address of the RADIUS client.
state
Optional. Specifies whether the RADIUS client is enabled or disabled.
sharedsecret
Optional. Specifies the shared secret that is also configured at the RADIUS client. The shared secret is used to validate messages between the RADIUS client and NPS.
requireauthattriube
Optional. Specifies whether verification for Access-Request messages is enabled or disabled.
napcompatible
Optional. Specifies whether the RADIUS client is compatible with the Network Access Protection (NAP) feature of Network Policy Server (NPS).
vendor
Optional. Specifies the RADIUS client vendor name. The default is RADIUS standard.
show client
Displays the RADIUS client list for the local NPS server.
